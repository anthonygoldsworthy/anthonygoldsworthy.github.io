                            batch, I wanted to highlight some of my all time favorites, among which is Arca's 2017
                            magnum opus,</i> Arca. <i>Disclaimer: I have no Spanish skills but we'll talk about that

                        <hr>
                        <br>
                        I stumbled upon Arca for a number of reasons. I, like many other teenagers, was watching
                        <i>Euphoria</i> back in 2019 and heard a song in the background of the penultimate episode that
                        caught my attention, and then completely forgot about it. I later rewatched it, and decided to
                        look into it, and then discovered that I had been listening to Arca all along because she has
                        worked extensively for FKA Twigs, and had worked on some other things The song in
                        <I>Euphoria</i> was called “Reverie” and is my all-time most played song. Now, I listen to a lot
                        of music (clearly) and generally would consider myself an “album” person in the sense that if I
                        enjoy a track I’ll give the entire album a listen. I honestly don’t know if that’s common and
                        I’m just delusional, but I also see how focused everybody seems to be with singles. TikTok seems
                        to be a huge factor in the music universe, and promoting a song is a lot easier that promoting I
                        imagine. I digress. What I mean to say in all of this is: I’ve listened to many albums in many
                        genres and this stands out as one of the most fascinating and beautiful projects I’ve ever had
                        the pleasure of listening to.
                        <br>
                        So let’s go track by track!
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <b>1. PIEL </b>When I first heard this song I was blown away by the emotion and ambience and I
                        still am now, but what’s changed is what I know about this album. All of her previous albums did
                        not feature any vocals, or at least not leading vocals. So for an earlier Arca fan, this was
                        brand-new territory. Using “Piel” to open the album really sets the tone for the rest of the
                        project. There’s also sort of a sense of dread over the entirety of the track, and it genuinely
                        makes you want to hear what’s next.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <b>2. ANOCHE </b>”Anoche” is where we start to get more of a sense for the vibes of the rest of
                        the album—it’s hard to describe what the production on the whole project sounds and feels like,
                        the best I can do is like… cyborg. And I mean that literally, it’s equal parts organic and
                        industrial. Anoche opens with a distorted piano and gradually is joined by vocals, and then some
                        more percussion—all of it feels very melancholic and alive.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <b>3. SAUNTER </b>I’ll be honest that this is not one of my favorites but I do think it serves a
                        purpose, which is to sort of let the listener breach. I’ll describe this experience as “working
                        on a stressful steam boat while somebody is playing piano and giving a short vocal performance
                        at the end. It’s a break from the heavier and more sad tracks that opened.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <b>4. URCHIN </b>This is an absolute highlight. This is again, very organic, but also leans into
                        a more industrial-sounding bass. The piano is great, the drop is great, everything is great. If
                        I had to ding it on anything, I’d say the runtime is a tiny bit inflated for casual listening.
                        Sitting down with headphones on, or perhaps in the car is the ideal place for this song.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <b>5. REVERIE </b>This is the one. The only way to describe this song accurately is “complex”.
                        Every time I listen to it I sit and wonder how somebody can even think to create something like
                        this. The song feels like it’s breathing because it’s just filled with sounds, and swells, and
                        so many other micro details that it is just jaw dropping. There is truly nothing I would change
                        about this song, and I wish I could hear it again for the first time. Everything feels like it
                        has purpose, and there’s little imperfections that… make it feel perfect? No notes.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <b>6. CASTRATION </b>This is another instrumentals only one, and it once again is a really nice
                        break from the heavy stuff. I would say this one leans more into the industrial side on paper,
                        but in practice, the organic elements shine through, because they feel like they’re getting
                        closer to you as the song progresses. It’s like a bionic cat aggressively meowing at you as it
                        approaches.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <b>7. SIN RUMBO </b>I was caught off guard when I first heard this because it’s genuinely an
                        amazing vocal performance. Seriously depressing track. Everything sort of feels like it’s
                        crying. Arca: crying, strings: crying, drums: crying, synth: crying. Regardless, it’s another
                        highlight, and I’d honestly go as far as calling it a career highlight. Preceding <I>Arca</i>
                        was a little EP that I was and still am obsessed with called <i>Entrañas</i> and “Sin Rumbo”
                        closed it out. The album version is different, as the original features the sounds of many
                        fireworks going off at the end, but they’re about the same in every other aspect.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <b>8. CORAJE </b>Arca is very much a maximalist, but the production here is stripped back a bit,
                        and it really shows a different and new side of Arca. It’s more intimate—pulling the production
                        back forces the vocals to take center stage, and once again we are just extremely melancholic. I
                        couldn’t tell you what this song is about simply because it’s in Spanish, but I can tell you
                        that it feels like heartbreak and longing.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <b>9. WHIP </b>I struggle to understand why this track made it to the album, it’s a black sheep.
                        But for somebody like me who was just getting into Arca from this album, it’s a little peek at
                        her more chaotic side. The song itself is literally just the sound of whips, but it’s also kind
                        of delightfully playful. It’s the song-ification of poking the bear; seeing how ridiculous you
                        remix the sound of a whip before it becomes annoying. She doesn’t ever wake the bear, but it’s a
                        close call. I appreciate the song and I don’t think it’s bad, but it’s just such a strange jump
                        from the previous track, and especially to the next one.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <b>9. DESAFÍO </b>This is probably one of the best songs of the 2010s, and I really mean that. I
                        wouldn’t classify it as my personal absolute favorite, but it’s among the top; that said I think
                        it’s probably her most well-produced one. The vocals are absolutely ethereal and they’re mixed
                        flawlessly into a pretty maximal backing track. And that’s precisely why I think it’s so
                        excellent, every element feels like it was placed with surgical precision, all while still
                        maintaining the human touch and emotion.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <b>10. FUGACES </b>Another vocal showcase, and a really beautiful one at that. I Googled the
                        lyrics in English because I always thought this song sounded like… healing? And it seems to be
                        kind of exactly about that. It’s certainly still melancholic, but it feels like you’re getting
                        all your negative feelings. When you listen to just the strings, they have that same “breathing”
                        element to them as mentioned before, but they really just keep expanding as new elements are
                        added.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <b>11. MIEL </b>This is another one where I am just baffled as to why it is where it is on the
                        track list. In fact, I’d go as far as to say this album may have very well been a 10 if this and
                        “Whip” switched places. Or if “Whip” were removed but that feels too hateful. Regardless, it’s
                        another extremely sad song that sort of undoes the vague feeling of hope that you get from
                        “Fugaces”. Or maybe none of this matters because everybody just hits shuffle. Who knows. Either
                        way, don’t get me wrong, it’s good.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <b>11. CHILD </b>What a closer. It’s an increasingly chaotic piano and it just feels like being
                        happy again. I think placing this at the end is quite literally just the happy ending we
                        deserve, and of course, Arca deserves. Things seem pretty bad but the extreme playfulness is a
                        great pick me up.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <hr>
                        <br>
                        I debated giving this a round 10, but I didn’t because while it has most of the makings of a
                        perfect album, but not all, as much as I wish it did. I want to assign ratings with some sort of
                        system instead of just throwing nonsensical values around. So here’s how the rating system
                        works:
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <b>ALL RATINGS ARE OUT OF 10.</b> This is a simple and fairly universal number to rate based on.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <b>A maximum of 3 points can be achieved based on the production.</b> This covers instruments
                        and mixing.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <b>A maximum of 3 points can be achieved based on the vocal performance and/or emotion conveyed.
                        </b>When I say “emotion conveyed” I’m referring to songs that have no words, so how well can
                        they convey a message despite that.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <b>A maximum of 3 points can be achieved based on the songwriting. </b>Plenty of songs and have
                        good production and good singing, but maybe the lyrics are a little stupid. This portion
                        accounts for that.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <b>A maximum of 1 point can be achieved based on track listing. </b>How did the artist want
                        people to listen to it? Am I seeing the vision? Does the order of the songs make sense? This is
                        likely where the most .5s are deducted. A zero indicates that the track listing was practically
                        nonsense, a .5 means it’s acceptable but could use some tweaking, and a 1, of course, is a
                        perfect layout.

                        oh wow, my very first note. quite honestly my life is pretty boring, but i figure this will be a
                        place to put things for when it gets interesting. like most people, i've got plenty of ideas,
                        but i'm either too lazy or too dumb to actually complete them. i spent some time writing some
                        video content things, and i think that'll be my next endeavor once this site gets published, but
                        i've still got lots to write and consider. i also imagine this is a place where i can put my
                        thoughts on new music, shows, and movies. maybe it'll just become a place to complain, who
                        knows.
